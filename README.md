# THINKETH

> Gain insight into how and why people think, act, and feel the way they do. The underlying AI applies linguistic analytics and personality theory to infer attributes from a person's unstructured text or Twitter feed.

This application is inspired by IBM's [Personality Insights demo](https://personality-insights-demo.ng.bluemix.net). Built entirely in React, this project not only put my React skills to test but also gave me the opportunity to learn more about [this fascinating service](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/personality-insights/index.html).

I needed a companion PHP server to communicate with Watson and Twitter API. I have some basic understanding of php and I folllowed along the ibm sdk and tutorials to execute it.
